### **What you need to do to start development?**

<details>
  <summary>1. Clone this repository</summary>

2. Use this as template repo on GitHub

3. Clone repository

   This usage is usefull when you want to keep git history, thanks to this you can sync incomming changes in this template

yarn
yarn start
```

- in that case you can also reinitialize repozitory if you don't want to keep history of commits

```bash

Ideally, it will be an organization created by the client (especially for production builds), to easily pass access after the end of development.

c. Create a new Project in the organization.

I. From the sidebar menu click <b>All projects</b> button:

![All projects](../../static/expo_all.png)

II. On the page with the list of projects click <b>+New Project</b> button:

![New project](../../static/expo_new.png)

III. Apply <b>display name</b> and <b>slug</b> of your project.

Display name is a name that will be visible in the Expo Dev Console. <br>
Slug is the name that will link your Expo application with your code.
