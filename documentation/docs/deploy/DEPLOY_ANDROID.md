```
{
    "build": {
        "production": {
            "android": {
                "buildType": "app-bundle" // you can choose here between apk and app-bundle
                // ...rest of the properties
            }
        },
         "staging": {
            "android": {
                "buildType": "app-bundle" // you can choose here between apk and app-bundle
                // ...rest of the properties
            }
        },
         "qa": {
            "android": {
                "buildType": "apk" // you can choose here between apk and app-bundle
                // ...rest of the properties
            }
