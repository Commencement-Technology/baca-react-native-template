# Overview

**Welcome in BACA starter!**

It is specialy designed to make react native apps development much easier and much faster.

## Why to use?

There are a lot of project starters for react native, we have some good features that other starters usually don't have:

- Fully works with **EXPO GO**
  - Good for start of the project, later you can switch to expo-dev-client
- Fully works on **WEB**
  - If you want to develop apps both on web and mobile this starter is good choice for you
- **Code generators** (create new screen / create new component and others)
- **Fully + Strong typed**
- **App deployment documentation**

## How to start?

1. Create new app - follow [this docs](/docs/bootstrap/create-new-app)

   - At this point you can start development
   - When you will need to show app to testers or client go to next step

2. Fill needed data to start deployment - follow [this docs](/docs/bootstrap/testing)

   - This will make all required changes to the code base

3. Prepare deployment - follow [this docs](/docs/deploy/intro)

   - Thanks to this docs you will have possibility to automatically deploy app to testers and

4. Send app to review and publish it on app stores

   - We don't plan to make docs about that, but maybe in the future we will do that!
