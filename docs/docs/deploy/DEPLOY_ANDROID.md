# Build & deploy the Android app

## Build first Android binary üïê / üì±

<ol>
<li>
Select the proper build type

You need to decide if you want to build an app that will be shared with Google Play Store or if it will be sent directly to final users.

If it will be deployed to the store you should build an <b>app-bundle</b> (.aab) file otherwise an <b>apk</b> (.apk) file.

Configure buildType in eas.json as follows:

```json
{
  // ...
  "build": {
    "production": {
      "android": {
        // success-line
        "buildType": "app-bundle" // you can choose here between apk and app-bundle
        // ...
      }
    },
    "staging": {
      "android": {
        // success-line
        "buildType": "app-bundle" // you can choose here between apk and app-bundle
        // ...
      }
    },
    "qa": {
      "android": {
        // success-line
        "buildType": "apk" // you can choose here between apk and app-bundle
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</li>
<li>
In the terminal run the build command (choose the proper environment (qa/staging/production)

```bash
yarn build:[qa/staging/production]:android
```

</li>
<li>
‚ö†Ô∏è You will be asked to generate a new Android Keystore. ‚ö†Ô∏è

If your app already exists (perhaps the app has already been deployed to the store) and you have the Keystore file press <b>n</b> and follow the steps.

If you do not have the Keystore file yet press <b>y</b>.

CONGRATULATION !! ü•≥ü•≥ You just started the first Android build of your app!

</li>
</ol>

## Build and deploy the next versions of the app to the Google Play Store. üåà / üïê / üì±

To run this step, ensure that you already have built and deployed the first version of the app (it means, that you need to go through steps 6 and 7 for qa / staging / production version of the app depending of your needs)

Only the first submission of the Android app needs to be done manually. Every next submission could be automated ü•≥.

To make it possible, <b>Google Service Account</b> key file needs to be provided.

<ol>
<li>
Generate <b>Google Service Account</b> key ‚Üí follow the instruction.

To generate the above you will need to contact with account owner of your project.

</li>
<li>
Put generated <b>Google Service Account</b> key in the root dir of your project.
</li>
<li>
Add Google Service Account key to .gitignore file.

```
your_google_service_account_key.json
```

</li>
<li>
Configure eas.json to use the <b>Google Account Service</b> key, and to send a new app version for the internal testing path.

```json
"submit": {
    "production": {
      "android": {
        // success-line
        "serviceAccountKeyPath": "path_to_your_google_service_account_key",
        "track":"internal"
      }
    },
    "staging": {
      "android": {
        // success-line
        "serviceAccountKeyPath": "path_to_your_google_service_account_key",
        "track":"internal"
      }
    },
    "qa": {
      "android": {
        // success-line
        "serviceAccountKeyPath": "path_to_your_google_service_account_key",
        "track":"internal"
      }
    }
}
```

</li>
<li>
Build and deploy a new version of the app

In project dir terminal run:

```bash
yarn deploy:[qa/staging/production]:android
```

Choose the proper app version depending on the environment for which you want to create a build.

CONGRATULATION !! ü•≥ü•≥ You have just automated the build and deployment process for Android!

</li>
</ol>
