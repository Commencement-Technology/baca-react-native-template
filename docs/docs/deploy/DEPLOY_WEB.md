## Resolving issues

1. 404 on deployed app

There could be an issue like this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58065603/netlify-renders-404-on-page-refresh-using-react-and-react-router

This was resolved by adding `_redirects` file to public folder.

For some servers this could not work so you should do this additional setup:

- configure `htaccess` on the server like this:

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /subdirectory
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```
